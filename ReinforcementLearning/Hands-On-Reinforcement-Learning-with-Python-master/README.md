**Master reinforcement and deep reinforcement learning using OpenAI Gym and TensorFlow**

## What is this book about?
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is the trending and most promising branch of artificial intelligence. Hands-On Reinforcement learning with Python will help you master not only the basic reinforcement learning algorithms but also the advanced deep reinforcement learning algorithms.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand the basics of reinforcement learning methods, algorithms, and elements
* Train an agent to walk using OpenAI Gym and Tensorflow
* Understand the Markov Decision Process, Bellman’s optimality, and TD learning
* Solve multi-armed-bandit problems using various algorithms
* Master deep learning algorithms, such as RNN, LSTM, and CNN with applications

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
policy_iteration():
Initialize random policy
for i in no_of_iterations:
Q_value = value_function(random_policy)
new_policy = Maximum state action pair from Q value
```
